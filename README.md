## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of favorite applications and its features:

    - keeps track of how long you read for daily
- Discord
    - edit and delete old messages
    - ability to message yourself

    - get personalized recommendations based on watch history
    - get notifications about new videos


App Idea:
An app that is designed to track the expiration date of food items in the fridge and pantry. The fundamental feature of this app should be the ability to manually input the food item with the expiration date and a way to sort the list of foods by expiration date. Some additional features I would like to implement is a way to scan an item with the camera instead of manually inputting it, ability to categorize the items of food by type, a nutrition feature that tracks the macronutrients and micronutrients, and a way to remind the user what food is expiring soon.

## Notes

No challenges encountered while building the app.
